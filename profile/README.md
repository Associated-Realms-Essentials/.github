# Welcome to Associated Realms Essentials
`Associated Realms Essentials` was created as a popietry lightweight addon for `Clidewood Realm`,
to help the administrators with moderation and to enhance the user experience.

We have recently decided to release Associated Realms Essentials,
because we believe that making this great addon available to the community for free was the best choice of action.

You can click on `Releases`, and then get the `.mcaddon` file to import the addon directly into minecraft.

# Notice
The addon may stop working every in-game update, this is due to it not being compatable with newer versions of the game and we have to manually update, and fix it.
Although it gets updated as frequently as possible, it is the consumers responsibility to come here and install the new pack update waiting for you.

We have to do this on `Clidewood Realm`, so imagine how much effort it takes us developers to update the addon every update, it is a very time consuming process so please dont get angry at us.
