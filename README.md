# Welcome to Associated Realms Essentials
Associated Realms Essentials was created as a popietry lightweight addon for Clidewood Realm to help the administrators with moderation and to enhance the user experience.
We have recently decided to release Associated Realms Essentials because we believe that making this great addon available to the community for free was the best choice of action, you can click on Releases and then get the .mcaddon file to import the addon directly into minecraft.
